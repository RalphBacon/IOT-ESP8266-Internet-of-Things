# IOT ESP8266 Internet of Things  
Upload data to **The Cloud** very easily using any ESP8266 board and my sketch  
Internet of Things (IoT) using an ESP8266 (Thingspeak Live Demo)

I need to upload some data to the "The Cloud" as part of a project I'm working on, so I thought I'd share the way I'm sending the data using a secure (SSL) mechanism to protect from prying eyes (or worse).

It's all very straightforward using an ESP8266 of some sort (even a tiny ESP8266-01 if you have just data to upload) and the change in data is reflected pretty much in real time.

There are graphs, and widgets and you can even see all the data on your phone without doing a thing (OK, you have to install an app).

There's a lot more I need to do with this project so stay tuned for further updates!
